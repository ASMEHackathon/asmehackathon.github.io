# Introduction

This 2021 ASME-CIE Hackathon is co-located with the International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference. The Hackathon is sponsored by the ASME Technical Events and Content (TEC) Sector Council and the ASME Computers & Information in Engineering Division (CIE) with the goal to build multi-stakeholder (society-university-industry) relations and impact the quality and quantity of data-skilled mechanical engineers. The ASME-CIE 2021 Hackathon is the second Hackathon event held by ASME and is expected to become one of the signature events of the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME).

<!-- #### Theme

Big Data is defined as “large volumes of high velocity, complex and variable data that require advanced techniques and technologies to enable the capture, storage, distribution, management, and analysis of the information.” However, it is reported that majority of the data collected (more than 80%) is unstructured data in the form of image, video, audio, undefined text and numbers. This is true in many mechanical engineering subfields where sensors are ubiquitous and digitization is pervasive, for example, when analyzing Amazon reviews to elicit customer preferences in support of engineering design, and using images of 3D printing in support of manufacturing prognosis. While the value of unstructured data is evident by the vigor and velocity with which new tools are being created in the private sector to extract this hidden value, in mechanical engineering, the question of how to leverage the power of unstructured data to benefit product design and development, manufacturing and complex systems engineering is still yet fully answer.

The ASME-CIE Hackathon attempts to provide an open mechanism for researchers to explore new statistical and machine-learning techniques appropriate for the use of unstructured text, images, audio etc. in design, manufacturing and systems engineering, and on the other hand, to develop new educational pathways to train the next generation of data-skilled mechanical engineers. The participants will have the opportunity to learn and experience various data visualization, data mining, and machine learning methods to develop automated processes for:

* Identification of patterns within the unstructured data that are predictive of valuable or negative attributes.
* Use of valuable extracted content to improve predictive models.
* Removal or correction of negative content associated with errors, bias, or privacy.

## <a name="HackathonProblem1"></a> Hackathon Problem 1: Digital Manufacturing – Obfuscating the design with security features


#### Problem Statement

A digital manufacturing (DM) process chain requires the use of computers, network connectivity, and cloud systems. Industry 4.0 continues to evolve towards the digital transformation of manufacturing, leading to concerns of hacking for sabotage and intellectual property protection. The unique threats faced by DM are side-channel attacks, direct sabotage, reverse engineering, and counterfeit production.

The objective of this hackathon problem is to assess the robustness of security strategies to hide design information in DM and stimulate the critical thinking process. An STL file of a dice will be provided, and participants are expected to determine the correct number for each face on the 6-sided dice. Teams would be required to present their solution approaches for completing each benchmark to a panel of judges. 

#### Challenges

* How can security strategies be developed and incorporated into a DM cyber-physical system? ([Mahesh et al., 2021](#RefsProblem1)) 
* What is the optimal approach to test the effectiveness of developing security strategies and to account for every classification of attacks in the DM supply chain? ([Linares et al., 2021](#RefsProblem1)) 
* How can the cybersecurity threats be minimized in digital manufacturing?
* Is current 3D printing technology safe from threats?

#### Datasets
The STL file shows a 3D model of a 6-sided dice and each side of the dice will contain 9 spherical indentations on the surface. Each side of the dice should represent a numbered face of the dice from 1 to 6 and no number is repeated on any of the sides. Clues will be hidden in the file for participants to reveal and determine which number corresponds to which exact face of the dice. The hints will reveal which of the 9 spherical dots are extraneous and the true numbered side of the dice can be determined. Teams will receive points based on how many puzzles they can decode correctly. 

Participants will be required to submit their solution based on the labeled dice shown in Figure 1. **For reference, the face of the dice numbered “6” is on the side labeled “C”**. In your submission, provide a table with your answers for the corresponding letters for each side, based upon the layout in the figure.

## <a name="HackathonProblem2"></a> Hackathon Problem 2: Automated Testing in Production Planning in Test based Engineering




#### Problem Statement

In the age of digitalization, it is critical to test, validate, and optimize real-world designs within the limitations of shorter testing cycles, conflicting performance requirements, growing product complexity, and reduced costs. The employment of data-based production resource management is geared toward reducing the total time required for flexible sequence of testing processes. Automated testing of engineering parts based on resource availability is a crucial part of production planning process. To ensure efficient testing solutions optimizing the speed of their testing cycles for so many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach. 

The Objective of this hackathon is to build a robust algorithm to predict and reduce the amount of time required by the engineering parts for testing on the test machines. Candidates will work with a dataset which represents different combinations of part features to predict and optimize the time it takes to pass testing. The second part of the challenge is to build a scheduling tool based on the predicted test time for automated testing and resource planning.


#### Task 1 Dataset

This dataset contains a series of undisclosed variables, each representing a component in a (H)EV Powertrain machinery. Each single row represents a component like battery. Motor, torque, coupler, drive, wheel, Aerodynamic drag coefficient, Rolling resistance coefficient, etc. Variables can be categorical, continuous, or binary. For example, a categorical variable could be speed, torque range and control strategies on sound quality, (torsional) vibrations, or energy efficiency. Continuous variable could be cell temperature, humidity %, fuel consumption, simulation error or number of resources used. Binary variables could be availability of pneumatic nozzles, sensor application, safety appliance status, phase number, etc.

The ground truth is labeled `y` and represents the time (in seconds) that the rotating machinery took to pass testing for each variable.

**File Description**

Variables with letters are categorical. Variables with 0/1 are binary values. And others are continuous variables.

* `train.csv` - the training set
* `test.csv` - the test set, you must predict the `y` variable for the `ID`s in this file


#### Task 2 Dataset

This dataset is a (H)EV Powertrain component assembly dataset. This dataset consists of 1 file: `matrix.csv`

**File Description**

`Matrix.csv` consists of test IDs (these test IDs can be found in test.csv from task 1), available material quantity and machine numbers on which test is performed. Each test ID is divided into categories (A1 – A6) which resemble a component in rotating machinery. For successful testing of the rotating machinery, test IDs from these categories should be tested in a specific sequence of component categories.

The general sequence of Test IDs to start a test - `A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A4 -> A6` OR `A1 -> A2 -> A3 -> A5 -> A6`. 

Example test - `1004 -> 6450 -> 185 -> 1466 -> 2080`, total time taken by the test is the addition of predicted `y` (from `test.csv` in task 1) for respective test IDs.

Machine selection - Machines numbers ranging from 1 to 12 form a matrix with test IDs. Y/N under machines signify whether machine is allocated for performing the test.

If matrix(test ID , machine #) = “Y” then that specific test can be performed on the corresponding machine number. You must select suitable Machine which can be used to test the sequential test IDs.

For the example test - `1004 -> 6450 -> 185 -> 1466 -> 2080` suitable machines for testing are 1, 5. Based on the machine availability user can select a machine for testing. 

Each test id uses use a single resource for testing. After each test resources are exhausted by 1. 


#### Submission File

*Task 1*: Prediction of time required for testing: For each `ID` in the test set, you must predict the `y` variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

``
ID,y  
1,150  
2,150.23  
3,155.78
...
``

*Task 2*: Building a Scheduling tool: Design and build a scheduling tool for automating the test schedule and planning resources for (H)EV Powertrain planner. 

Tool input: test sequence 
    1) 1004 -> 6450 -> 185 -> 1466 -> 2080 
    2) ...
    3) ...

Output: test sequence order, Machine #, resources used, wait time, If resources are exhausted or no machine available, print a message accordingly.

## <a name="HackathonProblem3"></a> Hackathon Problem 3: Melt Pool Monitoring Data Registration for Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing

#### Problem Statement

The powder bed fusion (PBF) process builds part layer-by-layer. The new layer is on either raw powder or previously solidified material. PBF-built part quality highly depends on process parameters such as laser power, scan speed, scan pattern, and other machine settings. There are also uncontrollable environmental factors or geometrical effects that may affect process stability. A common solution to this issue is to implement in-situ monitoring and real-time control. 

Coaxial camera-based melt pool monitoring (MPM) systems can generate high-resolution images at a high sampling rate, which provides an attractive solution to monitor the PBF process.In order to use MPM information for process monitoring and part quality control, relationships between metal PBF process parameters, melt pool characteristics, and material structure and properties need to be discovered. Proper data registration is a prerequisite for correlating melt pool characteristics to local structure and mechanical properties. The objective of this hackathon subtopic is to reconstruct the scan path from coaxial MPM images. Furthermore, each image frame should be registered with an estimation of the laser beam position associated with this frame. Participants need to use the given information such as scan profile, part geometry, and other process parameters to predict where each MPM frame was taken. 

#### Challenges

* How to correlate the MPM characteristics with scan path and process parameters? Hint, what specific characteristics in the scan commands can cause changes in the melt pool?
* How to extract useful features from MPM data to make the correlation?
* What is the best approach to efficiently register the MPM frames?
* How to remove the initial defects such as signal delay or missing data in the raw in-situ data?
* What are the uncertainty sources of your registration method? How to quantify them?

#### Datasets

An experimental L-PBF build was conducted on the Additive Manufacturing Metrology Testbed (AMMT) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The AMMT is a fully customized metrology instrument that enables flexible control and measurement of the L-PBF process. Two cameras were installed for process monitoring, including a high-resolution camera that captures the layerwise images of the entire part and a high-speed camera used to capture melt pool images. The Galvo mirror system and the beam splitter allow the high-speed camera to focus on the current laser melting spot. Emitted light from the melt pool, through an 850 nm bandpass filter (40 nm bandwidth), is imaged on the camera sensor. On AMMT, both Galvo and laser command are updated on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) at 100 kHz. The digital commands are developed to specify the motion of the Galvo scanner of the L-PBF system. It is transformed into a time series of scanner positions and laser power as control commands. 

Inconel 625 powder and build plate were used. A rectangular part (with chamfered corners) of dimensions 10 mm x 10 mm x 5 mm was laid on the substrate.
