# Introduction

This 2020 ASME-CIE Hackathon is co-located with the International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference. The Hackathon is sponsored by the ASME Technical Events and Content (TEC) Sector Council and the ASME Computers & Information in Engineering Division (CIE) with the goal to build multi-stakeholder (society-university-industry) relations and impact the quality and quantity of data-skilled mechanical engineers. The ASME-CIE 2020 Hackathon is the first Hackathon event held by ASME and is expected to become one of the signature events of the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME).

<!-- #### Theme

Big Data is defined as “large volumes of high velocity, complex and variable data that require advanced techniques and technologies to enable the capture, storage, distribution, management, and analysis of the information.” However, it is reported that majority of the data collected (more than 80%) is unstructured data in the form of image, video, audio, undefined text and numbers. This is true in many mechanical engineering subfields where sensors are ubiquitous and digitization is pervasive, for example, when analyzing Amazon reviews to elicit customer preferences in support of engineering design, and using images of 3D printing in support of manufacturing prognosis. While the value of unstructured data is evident by the vigor and velocity with which new tools are being created in the private sector to extract this hidden value, in mechanical engineering, the question of how to leverage the power of unstructured data to benefit product design and development, manufacturing and complex systems engineering is still yet fully answer.

The ASME-CIE Hackathon attempts to provide an open mechanism for researchers to explore new statistical and machine-learning techniques appropriate for the use of unstructured text, images, audio etc. in design, manufacturing and systems engineering, and on the other hand, to develop new educational pathways to train the next generation of data-skilled mechanical engineers. The participants will have the opportunity to learn and experience various data visualization, data mining, and machine learning methods to develop automated processes for:

* Identification of patterns within the unstructured data that are predictive of valuable or negative attributes.
* Use of valuable extracted content to improve predictive models.
* Removal or correction of negative content associated with errors, bias, or privacy.

Everyone will be placed in a team up to three members. You may form your own team onsite. All implementation must be based on the original work.
* Each Hackathon team will continue their own meetings and hacking exercises during the two days.
* Each team needs to present their teamwork including the technical approach and the results.

## <a name="HackathonProblem1"></a> Hackathon Problem 1: Digital Manufacturing – Obfuscating the design with security features


#### Problem Statement

A digital manufacturing (DM) process chain requires the use of computers, network connectivity, and cloud systems. Industry 4.0 continues to evolve towards the digital transformation of manufacturing, leading to concerns of hacking for sabotage and intellectual property protection. The unique threats faced by DM are side-channel attacks, direct sabotage, reverse engineering, and counterfeit production.

The objective of this hackathon problem is to assess the robustness of security strategies to hide design information in DM and stimulate the critical thinking process. An STL file of a dice will be provided, and participants are expected to determine the correct number for each face on the 6-sided dice. Teams would be required to present their solution approaches for completing each benchmark to a panel of judges. 

#### Challenges

* How can security strategies be developed and incorporated into a DM cyber-physical system? ([Kunath et al., 2018](#RefsProblem1)) 
* What is the optimal approach to test the effectiveness of developing security strategies and to account for every classification of attacks in the DM supply chain? ([Kunath et al., 2018](#RefsProblem1)) 
* How can the cybersecurity threats be minimized in digital manufacturing?
* Is current 3D printing technology safe from threats?

#### Problem Statement

Additive manufacturing (AM) processes build parts layer-by-layer directly from 3D models. AM enables the fabrication of complex heterogeneous parts, which makes it an attractive alternative for high-value, low-volume production. However, the turnkey deployment of the technology hits consistent barriers including low part repeatability and lack of effective qualification tools. Fundamental issues exist with the understanding and control of the dynamic and stochastic nature of AM processes. In-situ monitoring for additive manufacturing is considered as the main enablers to understand AM processes, set optimal material and machine specific process parameters, and close the control loops in real-time to limit the stochastic variability introduced by the dynamic nature of the processes. For manufacturers to build quality AM parts, in-situ data has the potential to be used for quality assurance and certification, which will dramatically reduce the need of lengthy and high-cost post inspections. 

The goal of this hackathon subtopic is to promote the use of data science in powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing to accelerate the understanding of powder-bed fusion AM process, to improve PBF process monitoring and control as well as to explore in-process data-based product qualification. This will be achieved by developing sets of data analytics tools, predictive models, and process control and optimization algorithms for PBF processes. This tool will be an early step in allowing industry to move away from 100% testing and towards born-qualified parts.

#### Challenges

* AM in-process data registration – how to align the multi-modal in-process monitoring data in time and space to allow for fusion and correlation ([Argyriou et al. 2015](#RefsProblem2)).
* What kind of features to be extracted from the multi-level, multi scale AM in-process monitoring data, e.g., build command, chamber monitoring trended data, co-axial images and layerwise images etc. 
* What kind of relationship between build commands and the in-process measurements such as coaxial melt pool characteristics/layerwise surface images. ([Yang et al. 2019a](#RefsProblem2), [Yang et al. 2019b](#RefsProblem2))
* How to fusion the data from the multi-modal in-process measurements ([Castanedo 2013](#RefsProblem2))
* How to develop real-time control or layerwise control strategy from the data for the PBF AM processes? ([Mani 2015](#RefsProblem2))

#### Datasets

An experimental L-PBF build was conducted on the Additive Manufacturing Metrology Testbed (AMMT) at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The AMMT is a fully customized metrology instrument that enables flexible control and measurement of the L-PBF process. Two cameras were installed for process monitoring, including a high-resolution camera that captures the layerwise images of the entire part, and a high-speed camera used to capture melt pool images. The Galvo mirror system and the beam splitter allow the high-speed camera to focus on current laser melting spot. Emitted light from the melt pool, through a 850 nm bandpass filter (40 nm bandwidth), is imaged on the camera sensor. On AMMT both Galvo and laser command are updated on field programmable gate array (FPGA) at 100 KHz. The digital commands are developed to specify the motion of the Galvo scanner of the L-PBF system. It is transformed into a time series of scanner positions and laser power as control commands.

Inconel 625 powder and build plate were used. The substrate has a dimension of 102 mm x 102 mm x 13 mm. Twelve rectangular parts (with chamfered corners) of dimensions 10 mm x 10 mm x 5 mm were laid on the substrate, with a minimum spacing of 10 mm between parts. Each part was built with a different scan strategy.

Data sets and data formats used for the study include:
1. Part Design model (.stl file)
2. Part layout (drawing in pdf/part location in xml)
3. Process settings; camera settings; and camera calibration models (PNG, jpg, xml)
4. Data sets for build command at 100KHz for every part every layer (xls)
5. Melt-pool images for every part, every layer at 2KHz (bmp/jpg/avi/PNG)
6. Layerwise images, 2 per layer, before and after exposure settings (bmp/PNG)
